<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is part of the selection process for the PHP developer position at [Moat](https://www.moat.ai/). The proposed challenge can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/2040915). For this challenge I tried to keep the code as cleaner and smaller as possible without giving up on organization and separation of concerns. Hope you can find this project useful. Please feel free to contact me any time with any questions about it.

### Built With

This project is built with the following tools/frameworks

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
* [MySql](https://mysql.com)

And the following APIs are consumed

* [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api) - *Artists images*
* Moat API - *Artists data*


### Usage

In order to use try this project live please access: [Live](http://hil.dev.br/moat)

Users *user@moat.ai* and *admin@moat.ai* already exists under the password : *123456*

### Improvements

As long this is a test project, I'll probably not take this forward, but if I would, these are some improvements I'd like to work on: 

* Tests coverage
* Docker-compose deploy structure
* Exception treatment to a more user-friendly set of messages and feedbacks.
* Ajax usage in registration forms
* Store images from Twitter on S3 or similar, updated once or twice a week. 
* Cache to store artist's information.
